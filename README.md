It would give a great value to companies when they launch products and understand the sentiment of users through different tweets and comments. This guarantees that the companies understand the behavior of the customers and make changes based on the sentiment and therefore, take actions based on insights from the comments and improve the overall revenue of the company respectively.

Using machine learning techniques and text extraction, we are going to be predicting the sentiment of the text whether it is positive or negative. First, we would be working with the text and check the different words present in the text and once we understand them, we would be performing the machine learning analysis respectively and use the deep neural networks. Then, we are going to be taking those values and performing machine learning operations and getting the predictions as to whether they are positive or negative. 

We would be using the natural language processing that is required when doing the machine learning analysis. Performing the natural language processing ensures that the words that are present are converted into mathematical vectors that are used for different macihne learning models for prediction. Once the mathematical vectors are converted into different vectors, they are given for the machine learning models for prediction respectively. Therefore, with the features that are present in the text along with some newly created features, the machine learning and deep learnimg models would be using those techniques and ensures that they are getting the best outputs respectively. 

Once we understand the different machine learning models, we are going to use the hyperparameter tuning which ensures that good set of hyperparameters are selected and this would result in machine learning models that creates the best results respectively. Once we get those important results for the hyperparameters, we are going to use them and ensure that we are getting the best accuracy for the machine learning models. We are going to learn the different hyperparameters and how they influence the machine learning models and the outcome of different problem statements. Therefore, let us now get an understanding of the project and see how these machine learning models are using for production respectively. 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once the Git is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to add the files or the repository.
3. You'll have to click on "Gitbash here" that would be opened when you right click on a particular location. One the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then copy the clipboard file that is present when you click on Code in Github.
4.  The link must be pasted and run so that the files would be downloaded at the location of interest.
Later, you'll need to use Anaconda Prompt and add "Jupyter notebook" in the prompt.
5. This would open the jupyter notebook that could be used to run and load the .ipynb files respectively. Therefore, you would be able to run the project at hand.
