Using machine learning techniques and text extraction, we are going to be predicting the sentiment of the text whether it is positive or negative. First, we would be working with the text and check the different words present in the text and once they understand them, we would be performing the machine learning analysis respectively and use the deep neural networks. Then, we are going to be taking those values and performing machine learning operations and getting the predictions as to whether they are positive or negative.
