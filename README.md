It would give a great value to companies when they launch products and understand the sentiment of users through different tweets and comments. This guarantees that the companies understand the behavior of the customers and make changes based on the sentiment and therefore, take actions based on insights from the comments and improve the overall revenue of the company respectively.

Using machine learning techniques and text extraction, we are going to be predicting the sentiment of the text whether it is positive or negative. First, we would be working with the text and check the different words present in the text and once we understand them, we would be performing the machine learning analysis respectively and use the deep neural networks. Then, we are going to be taking those values and performing machine learning operations and getting the predictions as to whether they are positive or negative. 

We would be using the natural language processing that is required when doing the machine learning analysis. Performing the natural language processing ensure that the words that are present are converted into a mathematical vectors that are used for different macihne learning models for prediction. Once the mathematical vectors are converted into different vectors, they are given for the machine learning models for prediction respectively. Therefore, with the features that are present in the text along with some newly created features, the machine learning and deep learnimg models would be using those techniques and ensure that they are getting the best outputs respectively. 

Once we understand the different machine learning models, we are going to use the hyperparameter tuning which ensures that good set of hyperparameters are selected and this would result in machine learning models created the best results respectively.
