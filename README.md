# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

It would give a great value to companies when they launch products and understand the sentiment of users through different tweets and comments. This guarantees that the companies understand the behavior of the customers and make changes based on the sentiment and therefore, take actions based on insights from the comments and improve the overall revenue of the company respectively. 



Using machine learning techniques and text extraction, we are going to be predicting the sentiment of the text whether it is positive or negative. First, we would be working with the text and check the different words present in the text and once they understand them, we would be performing the machine learning analysis respectively and use the deep neural networks. Then, we are going to be taking those values and performing machine learning operations and getting the predictions as to whether they are positive or negative.
